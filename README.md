# CreativesRebuildNewYork
identification verification, auto labeling


Custom Automation
A unique identifier (UID) will be assigned to each applicant based upon their submission and/or submitter profile. *
As new applicants submit their unique identifiers, they will be compared with existing applicants
If a new applicant matches any existing applicants from either project, both the new submission and the existing will be labeled. **

* Creatives Rebuild New York will be responsible for the unique identifier being truly unique. SSN is what Submittable suggests. If SSN is too sensitive to ask in this program, the alternative unique identifier should be generated from no more than three fields. If any false positive duplicates should appear with the same unique identifier, it is not Submittables responsibility to resolve. Any submissions missing required values for the UID, will be skipped.

** If the matched submission is in the Accepted or Completed status, a ‘Awarded Duplicate’ label will be applied. If the matched submission is in the Withdrawn or Decline status, a ‘Not Awarded Duplicate’ label will be applied. If the matched submission is in the New or In Progress status, a ‘Pending Duplicate’ label will be applied. Additional label variations will be considered a change of this SOW.
